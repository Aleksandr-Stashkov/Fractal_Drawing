# Fractal_Drawing
A little program created during my university years to test the geometric rule for drawing a fractal.

It is super user-unfriendly, so I will explain how to use it.

The upper button draws the set number of dots.

The lower button clears the drawing board.

The N field sets the number of dots drawn.

The C field chooses one of the preset configurations of base dots. The value entered here should be one of: 2, 31, 32, 41, 42, 43, 51, 52, 61, 62.

The m field sets the denominator in the algorithm. It is integer and should be above 1.

Basically, you should launch the exe-file and try combinations 31/2, 43/2, and 41/2.
